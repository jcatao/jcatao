- 👋 Hi, I’m @jcatao
- 👀 I’m a Software Engineer and Consultant with about 3 years of experience! Prior to becoming a dev, I studied Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on projects and expanding my skills with React, .NET, HTML, CSS (SASS/SCSS), Python, and more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning resources and knowledge.
- 📫 How to reach me: website coming soon!


I also thoroughly enjoy exercising, playing recreational sports, reading both non-fiction (for learning) and fiction (for entertainment),
listening to educational podcasts, and journaling.
