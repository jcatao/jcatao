- 👋 Hi, I’m @jcatao
- 👀 I’m interested in all things technology! Especially Software Engineering, Python, Django, Data Science, and Data Engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Django for web app development, REST API, Docker, and Kubernetes.

I also thoroughly enjoy exercising, playing recreational sports, reading both non-fiction (for learning) and fiction (for entertainment),
listening to educational podcasts, and journaling.
